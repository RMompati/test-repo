Abstract
Purpose International Diabetes Federation (IDF) stated that 382 million people are living with diabetes worldwide. Over the last
few years, the impact of diabetes has been increased drastically, which makes it a global threat. At present, Diabetes has steadily
been listed in the top position as a major cause of death. The number of affected people will reach up to 629 million i.e. 48%
increase by 2045. However, diabetes is largely preventable and can be avoided by making lifestyle changes. These changes can
also lower the chances of developing heart disease and cancer. So, there is a dire need for a prognosis tool that can help the doctors
with early detection of the disease and hence can recommend the lifestyle changes required to stop the progression of the deadly
disease.
Method Diabetes if untreated may turn into fatal and directly or indirectly invites lot of other diseases such as heart attack, heart
failure, brain stroke and many more. Therefore, early detection of diabetes is very significant so that timely action can be taken
and the progression of the disease may be prevented to avoid further complications. Healthcare organizations accumulate huge
amount of data including Electronic health records, images, omics data, and text but gaining knowledge and insight into the data
remains a key challenge. The latest advances in Machine learning technologies can be applied for obtaining hidden patterns,
which may diagnose diabetes at an early phase. This research paper presents a methodology for diabetes prediction using a
diverse machine learning algorithm using the PIMA dataset.
Results The accuracy achieved by functional classifiers Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree
(DT) and Deep Learning (DL) lies within the range of 90–98%. Among the four of them, DL provides the best results for diabetes
onset with an accuracy rate of 98.07% on the PIMA dataset. Hence, this proposed system provides an effective prognostic tool for
healthcare officials. The results obtained can be used to develop a novel automatic prognosis tool that can be helpful in early
detection of the disease.
Conclusion The outcome of the study confirms that DL provides the best results with the most promising extracted features. DL
achieves the accuracy of 98.07% which can be used for further development of the automatic prognosis tool. The accuracy of the
DL approach can further be enhanced by including the omics data for prediction of the onset of the disease.

Moreover, China is leading with this disease by 98 million
people affected or about 10% of the population and India is
the second leading country among the world as shown in
Fig. 1 with 65.1 million people suffering from diabetes till
2013 [2]. Diabetes has steadily been listed at the top position
for a major cause of death in America [3]. According to official statistics of 2017, an estimated 8.8% of the global population has diabetes and this is likely to increase to 9.9% by the
year 2045 [4].
In the past years of development in China, people having
diabetes are increasing alarmingly and this has acutely impacted every person’s life. The rate of impacted persons through

According to official statistics, the people affected by this
disease are nearly 110 million in 2017 [5].

Introduction
Diabetes can be considered as one of the main challenges in
the healthcare community worldwide and its impact is increasing at a very high pace. Consequently, it is the seventh major

Fig. 2 Increase of diabetes diagnosed males and females till 1990 to 2016

reason for the premature death rate in 2016 worldwide mentioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1].
According to the diabetes global pervasiveness, 1.6 million
got died each year because of diabetes [2]. WHO has demonstrated in its first global report that the number of persons
suffering from diabetes increased from 108 million (4.2%) to
422 million (8.5%) till the end of 2014 [6]. On world diabetes
day 2018, WHO has joined the partners from all over the
world for showcasing the impact of diabetes. According to
WHO, 1 in 3 adult is reported overweight and the problem

393

is increasing day by day. Diabetes is convicted as the main
reason for heart attack, kidney failure and stroke blindness [1].
Diabetes can be considered as a chronic disease in which
glucose (blood sugar) is not metabolized in the body (glucose
is produced from the food we eat); therefore, it increases the
level of sugar in the blood over the acceptable limits. In diabetes, the body is not able to generate insulin or to respond to
the produced insulin. Diabetes is incurable until now, but it
can be prevented with early knowledge. A person having diabetes is prone to severe complications like nerve damage,
heart attack, kidney failure, and stroke. High levels of glucose
in the body can cause the problem of hyperglycemia, which
results in abnormalities in the cardiovascular system [4] and
also causes serious problems in the functioning of various
human organs like eyes, kidneys, and nerves.
In Early diagnosis, the prediction and diagnosis of the disease are analyzed through a doctor’s knowledge and experience, but that can be inaccurate and susceptible. Healthcare
Industry collects a huge amount of data related to healthcare,
but that data is unable to perceive undetected patterns for making effective decisions [7]. Since manual decisions can be
highly dangerous for early disease diagnosis as they are based
on the healthcare official’s observations and judgment which is
not always correct [7]. There can be some patterns that remain
hidden and can impact observations and outcomes. As a result,
patients are getting a low quality of service; therefore an advance mechanism is required for early detection of disease with
an automated diagnosis and better accuracy. Various undetected errors and hidden patterns give rise to diverse data mining
and machine algorithms which can draw efficient results with
reliable accuracy [8]. Due to the day to day growing impact of
diabetes, a variety of data mining algorithms have been introduced for collecting hidden patterns from large healthcare data.
Further, that data can be used for feature selection and automated prediction of diabetes [4].
The main intent of this research work is to propose the
development of a prognostic tool for early diabetes prediction
and detection with improved accuracy. There have been an
extensive amount of data and datasets available on the internet
or external sources and the PIMA dataset which has been used
in this work is one of the most widely used dataset in many
researches and it is collected by the National Institute of
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). This
research work represents comprehensive studies done on the
PIMA datasets using data mining algorithms like DT, NB,
ANN, and DL [9].The comparison of algorithms is represented in a logical and well-organized manner from which DL
provides more effective and prominent results. DL is a technology that self-learns from data and is used effectively for
predicting diabetes nowadays [4]. A DL network is a technique that uses ANN properties in which neurons are interconnected to each other with lot of representation layers [4, 6,
10]. DL learns the representation of data by enlarging the level

of consideration from one layer to another hence increasing
the accuracy [9]. The model achieves high accuracy of
98.07% by employing DL in RapidMiner tool which proposes
a well-structured diabetes knowledge formatted for medical
officials and practitioners. Moreover, the task is to reduce
the efforts and to provide better results in comparison with
the traditional methods [11]. These machine learning methods
tend to improve the accuracy of the available methods. But
DL and ANN provide the best results as they are more reliable, robust and accurate in terms of prediction of the disease.
The remaining part of the paper is organized in the following manner: third section puts forth the previous important
work done on diabetes prediction using data mining algorithms. Fourth section of the paper presents the dataset description, data pre-processing process, and proposed methodology. Fifth section covers the results and discussion part. The
paper concludes in sixth section along with future scope.

Related work
Data mining techniques have overruled the existing methodologies with better prediction, accuracy, and precision.
Moreover, Machine learning is a technology of artificial intelligence that learns relationships between nodes without priory
training them [12]. The major ability of machine learning
techniques to drive the prediction model without strong training related to the underlying mechanism. Data mining and
machine learning methods help to detect the data which remains hidden while using the cutting-edge approach [13]. In
this section, we will review some previous studies to prove the
concept of data mining methods usability in the driving prediction model, mainly for diabetes.
Swapna G and others [4] made a study that Machine learning practice has proven useful and efficient to construct a
prediction model for diabetes using HRV signals in the DL
approach. The author was motivated through the deaths
caused by diabetes every year in the world which necessitated
avoiding the complication of the disease. The author developed a new predictive model using a convolutional neural
network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and an
ensemble model for detecting compound chronological characteristics of the input HRV data. Then SVM has been applied
to those detected characteristics for classifying the data. The
proposed system can be useful for healthcare officials and
clinicians to analyze diabetes using ECG signals. Nesreen
Samer El_Jerjawi and Samy S. Abu-Naser [14] proposed a
prediction model for diabetes using ANN (Artificial Neural
Network) that can be very useful for healthcare official and
practitioners. The author was motivated by the highly dangerous complication of the disease. He developed an ANN model
for minimizing the error function in the training. So the

394

average error function calculated was 0.01% and accuracy
attained through ANN was 87.3%.
Sajida Perveen et al. [15] recommended AdaBoost technology. An AdaBoost ensemble model is superior to the bagging
and J48 for the classification of a diabetic patient. The author
is inspired through the thriving impact of diabetes all over the
world, therefore, the prediction and prevention of diabetes
mellitus are attaining significance in the healthcare community [16]. The author presented a prediction model with improved performance for classification of Canadian population
diabetic patients across three different ages. There were three
ensemble models (bagging, AdaBoost and J48) which were
applied on test data to evaluate the performance and accuracy.
Results show that AdaBoost outperforms others in terms of
accuracy. According to authors AdaBoost can be applied to
another disease like coronary heart disease, hypertension for
better prediction.
Nahla H. Barakat et al. [17] presented an intelligent SVM
model for diagnosing diabetes. According to authors’ diabetes
is a major health issue worldwide and revealed that there are
80% of complications of type 2 diabetes can be prevented if
detected at an early stage. In the proposed scenario, many data
mining and machine learning algorithms have been analyzed
for diabetes prediction. The authors proposed the SVM model
with an additional module for turning the “black box” model
of an SVM into an understandable depiction. The system
gives a decision on SVM classification with prominent accuracy. Han Wu et al. [5] proposed a novel model for the detection and prognosis of diabetes mellitus type-2 using K-means
and logistic regression algorithms. The proposed method ensures the amplification in prediction accuracy which consists
of both cluster and class methods. The proposed methods
enhance accuracy by 3% in predicting diabetes.
Stefan Ravizza et al. [18] explains about the uses of data
mining techniques in healthcare and proposed a model for
measuring the hazard of unrelieved disease. They have applied healthcare supported, data-driven and characteristic assortment strategy on real-world data rather than Deep Patient
strategy and compared it with clinical data by applying it on
direct algorithms. Miotto et al. [19], suggested an unsupervised methodology named as Deep Patient, for the risk prediction concerning numerous diseases by applying diverse
features. Thus DL helps to extract more precise features for
data-driven analysis. In essence of machine learning uses in
the prognosis of diseases Alade et al. [20] presented a method
for diabetes prophecy by designing the ANN and Bayesian
network along with four-layer ANN architecture which gives
back-propagation method and Bayesian regulation algorithm
for training and testing of the dataset. The data has been
trained in such a way that it shows the results accurately on
the regression graph. Diagnosis can be done remotely through
this model and it can communicate with the patients without
being around them.

In the year 2017 Carrera et al. [21] suggested a computerassisted methodology for the detection of diabetic retinopathy,
based on the digital signals processing of retinal images. The
major aspiration of this proposed approach is the categorization of the position of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy at
any of the retinal image. The main advantage of this approach
is that it is robust in nature but precision and accuracy are
needed to improve for the documented application matter.
Diabetes retinopathy is chronic and has become the leading
lifestyle ailment. A long run of this disease can cause heart
failure, kidney failure; improper functioning of stomach,
prolonged elevated blood sugar levels and many more. By
considering this issue Huang et al. [22] proposed SVM and
entropy methodologies for the application of three different
datasets (diabetic retinopathy Debrecen, vertebral column,
and mammographic mass) for measuring the accuracy. The
authors tested the combined approach of DL and SVM for
the evaluation of the training dataset layer by layer and the
most critical attribute was taken to construct the decision tree.
The suggested method attains promising classification precision. As a result, it has been observed that diabetic retinopathy
Debrecen and mammographic mass gives more accurate outcomes and efficiency.

Methodology
Healthcare data
The dataset used for the study is PIMA Indian dataset (PID) by
NIDDK. The main motivation behind using the PIMA dataset
is that most of the population in today’s world follows a similar lifestyle having a higher dependency on processed foods
with a decline in physical activity. PID is a long term cohort
study since 1965 by NIDDK because of the maximum risk of
diabetes. The dataset contained certain diagnostic parameters
and measurement through which the patient can be identified
with any kind of chronic disease or diabetes before time. All of
the Participants in PID are females and at least 21 years old.
PID composed of a total of 768 instances, from which 268
samples were identified as diabetic and 500 were non-diabetics. The 8 most influencing attributes that contributed towards the prediction of diabetes are as follows: several pregnancies the patient has had, BMI, insulin level, age, Blood
Pressure, Skin thickness, Glucose, DiabetesPedigreeFunction
with label outcome (Table 1). Figure 3 demonstrates the diverse characteristics of each attribute and their range used in
the PIMA dataset in graphical form.
The Pima Indian dataset is taken from the URL https://data.
world/data-society/pima-indians-diabetes-database and splits
in an 80/20% ratio into the training and validation set. The
validation part is 20% of the input dataset which has been
selected to direct the selection of hyperparameters.

Technically, the validation set performs training of
hyperparameters before the optimization [23]. Crossvalidation has been used for estimating the statistical performance of the learning model. It executes two sub-processes as
testing and training. The training subprocess is used to train a
model and then the learning model is applied in the Testing
subprocess to measure the accuracy.
The reason for choosing Pima Indian dataset is the high
prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the Pima group of Native
Americans living in the area which is now known as central

and southern Arizona. This group has survived with a poor
diet of carbohydrates for years because of the genetic predisposition [24]. In recent years, the Pima group gain a high
indication of diabetes due to the sudden shift from traditional
crops to processed foods.

Data pre-processing
Most of the collected data is liable to be influenced as reckless.
Besides this, the data quality is important as it affects the

396

prediction results and accuracy to a large extent [4]. Therefore,
Datasets need to be properly balanced and divided between
testing and training data at a certain ratio, So that sampling can
be done efficiently for better prediction outcomes. Sampling is
a process of selecting a representative portion of data for
extracting characteristics and parameters from large datasets
consistently; therefore, it can contribute in a better manner
concerning the training model of machine. For maintaining
that consistency we need to apply some sampling techniques
(linear sampling, shuffled sampling, stratified sampling, and
automatic sampling) on the dataset, that sampling techniques
randomly splits the dataset into subsets and evaluates the prediction model. Those diverse sampling techniques perform
dissimilar permutation and combination of a representative
set of information from the collected data which are shown
here.

Linear sampling: This sampling technique linearly divides
the dataset into partitions as dataset representative. Along
with that, it doesn’t change the sequence of tuples and
fields in the subsets.
Shuffled sampling: This sampling technique split the
dataset randomly and builds subsets from the applied
dataset. Data selected arbitrarily for assembling subsets.
Stratified sampling: This sampling technique split dataset
arbitrarily and constructs the subsets. But the method also
certifies that the distribution of class should be static all
over the dataset. For example, if the used dataset has used
binominal classification, then stratified sampling method
constructs build arbitrary subsets in such a way that every
subset include roughly the same proportions of the two
value of class labels.
Automatic: The automated sampling method uses stratified sampling as the default sampling technique depends
on the features of the dataset. If the technique doesn’t go
with the type of data then it uses a suitable one.

Proposed work
The main object of this study is to present the most promising
features that are needed to predict the patient having diabetes
at an early stage. An ample amount of research work has been
done on the invasive automated discovery of diabetes.
Therefore, it all depends on what features were extracted and
which type of classifier has been applied upon to get the maximum outcome. Hence, Diversity of learning has been analyzed that these factors of the dataset can be applied for classifying diverse risk factors for prophecy [25, 26]. This paper
presents the all-embracing studies conducted on the PIMA
dataset. The association of diverse classification algorithms
evaluated on the various strata will maintain a wellorganized format for the discovery of diabetes along with

managing their hazard dimensions and treatment strategies
for medical practitioners.
This proposed methodology consists of two main parts,
first how accuracy is obtained using diverse classification
models and second is model validation. There are varied machine learning methodologies available that are constructive to
analyze the undetected patterns for evaluation of risk factors in
diseases like diabetes. Further, it is being observed that the
presentation of conventional methods is not up to the acceptance level in speech and object recognition because of a high
dimension of data [4]. The inadequacy of machine learning
algorithms boosted the DL research and it tends to produce
more accurate results and dominates other algorithms in terms
of accuracy. A lot of research has been done in healthcare by
implementing DL in anomaly detection. Related to diabetes
prediction, our proposed model achieved the highest accuracy
to date on the PIMA dataset i.e. 98.07%.
Four data mining algorithms i.e. DT, NB, ANN, and DL
are applied on the PIMA dataset for the evaluation of efficiency that is directly proportioned to the accurate decisions. Our
proposed method has been chosen based on a task associated
with the prophecy of diabetes disease. Rapid miner provides a
user-friendly and interactive Graphical user interface for assembling prediction models and pre-processing of data with
efficient accuracy in minimal time. Therefore, Rapid miner
Studio 9.2.000 has been used in our proposed methodology;
it has different features like drag and drop, wisdom of crowds
and many more for hands-on suggestions during the
workflow. Rapid miner provides 400 additional operators for
many data mining aspects which are not available in Weka.
These additional 400 operators contain diverse classification
techniques, pre-processing methods, validation, and visualization techniques that are not available within Weka. As rapid
miner user-interface is very convenient, therefore all the work
has been done on this tool which is time-efficient for a researcher when compared to the programming language [27].
Other than the interface rapid miner has more merits which are
further illustrated.
Usability can be considered as one of the first merits of
rapidminer because the dataflow in a rapid miner is same as
the tree-based structure. It ensures the automatic validations
and optimization for large scale data mining which is a bit
complicated and difficult in graph-based layout. The second
merit of the rapid miner is efficiency as it has been observed
by users that rapidminer can handle larger datasets with minimal memory consumption in comparison to the Weka [27].
Figure 4 shows the flow chart of the proposed model.

relationship among the data elements [4, 5]. DL is a form of
Machine learning which is different from traditional methods
in a way that it learns from various representations of raw data.
It allows different computational models that contain several
processing layers based on ANN to process and represent data
with various abstraction levels [28].
DL is a multilayer feed-forward perceptron based model
which also facilitates the properties of ANN and trained with
stochastic gradient descent using back-propagation. The network is a collection of four layers emulating nodes and neurons, directed in uni-direction (one-way connection). Each
node is connected to the next node in a single way connection
and contains two hidden layers where each node trains a copy
of global model parameters by applying its local data. Further,
it uses multiple threads to process the model and apply the
averaging for contributing to the model access across the
whole network. The learning model uses stochastic gradient
descent training using backpropagation and hidden layer’s
neurons which enable more advance features like tanh, rectifier and maxout activation, learning rate, rate annealing.
Among all the activation methods maxout provides the most
prominent results. Our proposed model used one Input layer
for data entry, one output layer for prediction result and two
hidden layers for iterative execution of dataset in DL neural
network as represented in Fig. 5.

Model optimization or parameter setting is one of the
toughest challenges in the model implementation of machine
learning. Typically model optimization refers to the optimization of code to minimize the testing error, however, deep
learning optimizes its model by tuning the elements that live
outside the model but have a high influence on its behavior
and classification. The criteria of parameter sets are flexible
and hidden, thus there are advanced features such as adaptive
learning rate, mean bias, momentum training, dropout, and L1
or L2 regularization which have been considered for minimizing the testing error [23]. Some of the key parameters are
discussed in Table 2.
Learning Rate is called the mother of all hyperparameters,
it measures the speed of learning progress in a model so that it
can be used to optimize its capacity. The next parameter of a
deep learning algorithm is the Number of Hidden units, it is a
classic parameter in deep learning algorithms, as it regulates
the representational capacity of the model. Another parameter
is L1 & L2 Regularization, which is a key parameter to prevent overfitting in the model. Some of the regularization
methods are implemented to create a less complex model
and to address the overfitting, feature selection. If a model
uses the L1 regularization technique then the model would
be called Lasso Regression and model which uses L2 is
known as Ridge Regression [29].

Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
Operator) or L1 regularization adds “absolute value of magnitude” of coefficient as a regularization term to the loss function to avoid underfitting. It can be calculated using (1) and
another merit of Lasso Regression is that it shrinks the less
significant parameters to zero to train the model with the most
important parameters.

Ridge regression or L2 regularization adds “squared magnitude” of coefficient as a regularization term to the loss function. This works well when the
dataset has fewer features in the dataset, hence over fitting must be avoided
while training and testing the model [30]. The cost function of Ridge regression could be designed using (2).

Decision tree
DT is a graph which is used in decision analysis and demonstrate outcome as a splitting rule for every specific attribute. It
is a branching graph which can be applied as visually and
explicitly for decision-making outcome. Every attribute is
considered as a branching node and constructs a rule at the
end of the branch that divides values belonging to different
classes. It is a tree-like structure as its name suggests and
concludes some decision at the end that is called the leaf of
the tree. The root is the most potential attribute which can be
applied for prediction of the outcome of rule formation. A DT
is simple and easy to implement, along with these advantages,
it predicts the results more accurately [31]. Construction of
new nodes is iterated until a base condition has not been
met. The class label attribute is resolutely based on the maximum value of the rule, which leads to the leaf node during the
DT analysis [32]. DT is constructed upside down with its root

at the top but decision trees are susceptible aligned with
overfitting. Overfitting is a problem when a tree gets over
skilled with data and its leaf shows minimal impurity, therefore pre-pruning is the process to cut the leaves which are not
significant and meaningful for tree construction. Pre-pruning
specifies that base criteria should be maximal than the depth of
the tree for the production of a DT model. Moreover, prepruning helps to increase prediction accuracy. Another important criterion for DT split is Information gain, which suits to be
more accurate for the prediction of outcomes from all other
criteria. In this method, entropy is calculated for each attribute
and then the attribute with minimal entropy is selected for the
split.
Since, the decision tree is primarily a classification
model, so the parameter optimization in the decision
tree is searching for the set of constraints that will optimize the model architecture [33]. The parameters to
tune in the decision tree are maximal depth, criteria,
confidence, minimal gain, minimal leaf size and minimal size for a split which are discussed here.
The first parameter to tune in a decision tree is criteria. This
parameter regulates the criteria on which the impurity of a split
is measured and split value is optimized for each criterion
concerning the selected criteria. Since split criteria can be
information gain, gain ratio and Gini index [34]. The Gini
index and entropy of a decision tree are designed using (3)
and (4) for choosing the best splitting criteria. The applied
decision tree is using information gain for the split criteria,
because of its all merits as explained.

Entropy : HðEÞ ¼ −∑cj¼1 PjlogPj

ð4Þ

Many of the researchers said that the splitting criteria
don’t make much difference in terms of tree performance as each criterion has its own merits and demerits
[34]. Another optimal parameter in the decision tree is
Maximal Depth. The depth of the tree varies depending
on the characteristics and size of the dataset. The deeper
the tree, the more splits it will have and it will collect
more information about the data. Therefore, according
to the dataset the tree size has been set in the range
of 1–20. Confidence tends to be another important parameter of DT which specifies the confidence level used
for the calculation of pessimism for the pruning process.
The confidence level is considered to be 0.1 for the
above decision tree.
Naive Bayes
NB is a DT based supervised classification algorithm [35]
which only differs in the representation of its outcome.
Where the DT provides the rules at the end, NB defines the

probability. Both algorithms are used for prediction purposes.
Moreover, NB provides a conditional probability. The major
advantage of the NB is that it can deal with a small dataset and
its high passes the low variance classifier which works using
Bayes theorem and finds the feasibility of the attribute associated with an object by using the important information.
Along with this, it is easy to implement and computationally
low-priced. In NB all the attribute values are independent of
each other, therefore, it is inexpensive in computation and
separately simplifies the assumption and calculation using
(5). In Naive Bayes classifier parameter tuning and optimization is limited [36].

Artificial neural network
ANN is another technique for classification which is a machine learning algorithm and provides more accurate results in
comparison with the existing algorithms. It is a mathematical
model that is inspired by the functioning and structure of biological neurons. A neural network is a connection of multiple
neurons connected as the human brain is a connection of 86
billion biological neurons. The functional connectivity in artificial neurons is mesh connectivity and each neuron has
equal weight [37]. The interconnectivity of neurons works
on the principle of the connectionist approach (the principle
of connectionist follows that the mental phenomena described
by the simple and uniform connectivity of neurons). Along
with this ANN consists of one or more hidden layers that
process the information through neurons and each node works
as an activation node; it classifies the outcome of artificial
neurons for a better outcome. The major finding of an ANN

is that it finds the complex relationships between data and
draws useful patterns [38].
Parameters selection and optimization plays a vital role
in a classifier. Therefore the hyperparameter that was selected for this classifier implementation is discussed here.
There is Number of the parameter which can be optimized
to reduce the training error, thus hidden units per layer are
selected as one of the parameters which specify the name
and size of the layers, and it allows the user to set the
structure of the neural network. Moreover, these layers
must be chosen practically to find a sweet spot between
high bias and variance and finally, it depends on the data
size used for training. Therefore, according to the training
data, two hidden layers have been used to set the applied
structure of the neural network. The next parameter is the
Training Cycle which specifies the number of cycles required for the training of the neural network. The number
of training cycles used in this implemented model is 500.
The next optimization technique is gradient descent which
finds the minima, controls the variance and accordingly
updates the parameters of the model which can be calculated using (6).

Result and discussion
In this research work, outcomes were achieved by applying
four classification algorithms (DL, ANN, NB, and DL) to
display maximize accuracy in diabetes prediction. From these
four classifiers, DL and DT provide promising accuracy
(98.07%) which can be proven as a prominent tool for the
prediction of diabetes at an early stage. In our proposed system we use the PIMA dataset and apply it on a DL approach.
Further, it can help the healthcare practitioner and can be the
second estimation for the betterment of decisions depending
on extracted features [39]. Many researchers have been previously worked on the PIMA dataset with a diverse algorithm to
predict diabetes. Thus some of the researcher’s work has been
represented with their applied methods and achieved accuracy.
Table 3 shows all the promising work done on Pima dataset till
time and our proposed method achieved the highest accuracy
i.e. 98.7 on PIMA Indian dataset.
Classification accuracy can be described as the “percentage
of true prediction” or it is a sum of the true positive and true
negative divided by the sum of predicted class value, it can be
calculated using (7).

Another optimal parameter of ANN is the learning rate,
it changes in weights at each step and responsible for the
core learning characteristics in the model. It must be chosen very wisely as too high a learning rate can complicate
the selection of minima and too low can slow down the
learning speed. It must be selected in the power of 10,
specifically 0.001, 0.01, 0.1,1. The value of the learning
rate in the model set to 0.1.

Here X represents the classification accuracy, t is the number
of correct classification and n is a total number of samples.
When a robust model has been proposed, accuracy alone is
not adequate to decide whether the model is good enough to
solve the problem. Therefore additional measures are required
to evaluate the performance of the classifier. Thus these additional measures are Class recall, class precision, and
F-measure. Class recall can be described as the number
of attributes, which were classified correctly. It can be

explained in another way, that it is the number of total
positive predictions divided by the number of total positive class values, It can also be called Sensitivity or the
True Positive Rate as represented in (8).
Recall ¼ TruePositives=ðTruePositives þ FalseNegativesÞ ð8Þ

The second measure for performance evaluation is Class
Precision, It can be defined as the sum of true positive and true
negative. In another way, it is the number of True Positives
predictions divided by the number of True Positives and False
Positives as shown using (9).
Precision ¼ TruePositives=ðTruePositives þ FalsePositivesÞ

ð9Þ

Another measure for performance evaluation is F-measure orF-score, it conveys the balance between the recall and prediction.
The formula for representing the F-score is given as (10).

F−Score ¼ 2*ððprecision*recallÞ=ðprecision þ recallÞÞ

ð10Þ

The accuracy obtained through diverse classifiers is shown
below by the confusion matrix which consists of class precision, diabetes prediction yes, diabetes prediction no, class recall. Another performance measure could be Specificity,
which is the proportion of values without the disease who test
negative. In the form of probability, notation Sensitivity could
be calculated using (11).

98.07%. Figures 6 and 7 shows the comparison between the
performance matrices of diabetes prediction technique.
As shown in the above Figs. 6 and 7 DL provides the
highest accuracy among all algorithms and proven to be the
best classifier algorithm for diabetes prediction. The accuracy
of 98.07% has been achieved on the PIMA dataset which is
the highest accuracy obtained to date. The maximum accuracy

can be obtained by consequential and significant data collection. Those attributes that don’t contribute to the classification
outcome should be prune. In this study, we have some facts
about the classification algorithm that information gain gives
better results in DT classifier and activation should be maxout
at the time of functioning in DL for a better outcome.

Conclusion and future work
This paper aimed to implement a prediction model for the risk
measurement of diabetes. As discussed earlier, a large part of
the human population is in the hold of diabetes disease. If
remains untreated, then it will create a huge risk for the world.
Therefore In our proposed research, we have put into practice
diverse classifiers on the PIMA dataset and proved that data
mining and machine learning algorithm can reduce the risk
factors and improve the outcome in terms of efficiency and
accuracy. The outcome achieved on the PIMA Indian dataset
is higher than other proposed methodologies on the same
dataset using data mining algorithms as discussed in Table 1.
Accuracy achieved by the four classifiers (DT, ANN, NB, and
DL) lies within the range 90–98% which is considerably high
than available methods. Among the four proposed classifiers,
DL is considered as the most efficient and promising for analyzing diabetes with an accuracy rate of 98.07%. In the future,
we intend to develop a robust system in the form of an app or a
website that can use the proposed DL algorithm to help
healthcare specialists in the early detection of diabetes.
